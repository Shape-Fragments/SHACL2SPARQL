# Shape fragments to SPARQL
The main goal of this project is to translate SHACL shapes to corresponding SPARQL queries according to the shape fragments specification.

It provides two interesting features:
- parsing a SHACL shapes graph to an intermediate SANode tree representation; and 
- translating the SANode tree to SPARQL queries according to the shape fragments specification.

# Dependencies
Create a python 3 virtual environment and install `requirements.txt` with pip.
